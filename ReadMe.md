# LearnC++

## Project descritpion

This project is meant to improve C++ mastering as a personnal task.
It's made from two main sources:
- StudyPlan.dev (https://www.studyplan.dev/cpp)
- Programmer en C++ moderne (Claude Delannoy, Editions Eyrolles, 2019)

Two source folders will seperate the origin of the notion learned.
Each chapter will have it's own dedicated file, or more if needed.

## Install and run

1. Clone the project.
2. Once the project cloned, select the file you want to run by importing it in he main.cpp file.
3. Then, compile it and run it.

## Use

Feel free to explore the code, as you want, and learn or improve any skill.
If you want to run any part of the code, just include it in main.cpp file and call the function(s)
you want.

Every file got its own namespace, to avoid name conflicts.
